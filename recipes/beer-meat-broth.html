     <h3>Description</h3>

     <p>
            There’s no greater comfort food than a hearty stew. 
            And Irish Beef and Guinness Stew might be the king of them all!
            Guinness gives the sauce an incredible rich, deep flavour, and the beef is fall-apart tender. 
            Stove, oven, slow cooker or pressure cooker – 
            directions provided for all.

<!-- List of ingredients -->
     
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     
        <ul>

            <li><p><strong>Beef – </strong>Diced in big chunks.</p></li>
        
            <li><p><strong>Garlic and onion – </strong>essentials.</p></li>
            
            
            
            <li><p><strong>Bacon</strong> – adds extra flavour! Can be skipped, or sub with pancetta or speck.</p></li>
            
            
            
            <li><p><strong>Carrot and celery</strong> – potatoes could also be added.</p></li>
            
            
            
            <li><p><strong>Flour and tomato paste</strong> – to thicken sauce and the tomato paste also adds some flavour.</p></li>
            
            
            
            <li><p><strong>Guinness Beer and broth/liquid stock</strong> – the braising liquids. I prefer using&nbsp.
                <em>chicken</em> rather than&nbsp.<em>beef broth</em> because it allows the flavour from the Guinness beer to come through better.&nbsp.
                <em>Don’t worry, it doesn’t taste like beer at all, it transforms into a deep savoury sauce! Also, all the alcohol is cooked out.</em></p></li>
            
            
            
            <li><p><strong>Thyme and bay leaves – </strong>to add a hint of flavour the sauce.</p></li>
          
        
     </ul>

<!-- Steps -->

     <h3>Steps:</h3>

     <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Brown the beef</strong> – brown them well, this is key to flavour. It’s not just the browned beef itself, also the brown bits left on the bottom of the pot (fond) adds extra flavour to the sauce.</p></li>
        
        
        
        <li><p><strong>Sauté flavour base</strong> – onion, garlic, bacon (speck or pancetta), carrot and celery.</p></li>
        
        
        
        <li><p><strong>Cook off flour and tomato paste.</strong></p></li>
        
        
        
        <li><p><strong>Add liquids</strong> – beer, broth and herbs.</p></li>
        
        
        
        <li><p><strong>Simmer</strong> covered for 2 hours until the beef is pretty tender, then simmer for a further 30 minutes uncovered to let the sauce reduce a bit and for the beef to become “fall apart tender”.</p></li>
     </ol>
